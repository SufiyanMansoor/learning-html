    What is HTML?
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
<BR>
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    <br>
        HTML describes the structure of a Web page
    <br>
        HTML consists of a series of elements
    <br>
    HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
    <br>
    HTML elements are represented by tags
    <br>
    HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
    <br>
    Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page
